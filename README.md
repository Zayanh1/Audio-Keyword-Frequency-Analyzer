# Audio-Keyword-Frequency-Analyzer
Audio Keyword Frequency Analyzer is a specialized speech processing utility developed to perform high-precision Keyword Spotting (KWS) within long-form audio data. The system is engineered to audit verbal patterns by transcribing audio and mapping specific linguistic tokens to their exact temporal coordinates.

Core Functionality
The analyzer facilitates the quantitative study of speech by identifying and counting targeted phrases (e.g., "guys," "guise," "skies"). Unlike standard transcription services, this tool is optimized for Phonetic Discrimination, using contextual analysis to differentiate between phonetically similar terms that often cause false positives in lower-tier models.
